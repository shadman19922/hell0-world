Just learning how to make repositories


Hello Saqib!!

As youve noticed, your thesis work has lead to a lot of code writing. Liek, a lot!! As you've noticed by now, your NOvA workspace is a mess. Github is an avenue for you to post work that's been cleaned up.

Furthermore, you won't hold onto that thing forever.

Sincerely Yours,
